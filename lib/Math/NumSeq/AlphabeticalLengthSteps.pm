=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::AlphabeticalLengthSteps -- iterations of length in characters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::AlphabeticalLengthSteps;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::AlphabeticalLengthSteps->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a count of how many times iterating
S<i -E<gt> AlphabeticalLength(i)> until reaching a cycle.

    i     = 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 
    value = 3, 3, 2, 0, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, ...

For example i=6="six" is 3 letters, then 3="three" is 5 letters, 5="five" is
4 letters, and 4="four" is its own length.  This took 3 steps to reach the
cycle at 4-E<gt>4.  At i=4 the value is 0 for no steps to reach a cycle
"four"=4.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::AlphabeticalLengthSteps-E<gt>new ()>

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::AlphabeticalLengthSteps-E<gt>new (lang =E<gt> $str)>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=back

=head2 Random Access

=over

=item C<$value = $seq-E<gt>ith($i)>

Return the number times to apply AlphabeticalLength until reaching a cycle.
