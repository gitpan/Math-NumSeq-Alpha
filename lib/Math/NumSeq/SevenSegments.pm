=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::SevenSegments -- count of segments to display by 7-segment LED 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::SevenSegments;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::SevenSegments->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is how many segments are lit to display i in 7-segment LEDs

    i     = 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ...
    value = 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6, 8, 4, 7, 7, 6, 7, 8, 5 ...

The segments for each digit are

     ---                 ---       ---           
    |   |         |         |         |     |   |
                         ---       ---       --- 
    |   |         |     |             |         |
     ---                 ---       ---           

     ---       ---       ---       ---       --- 
    |         |             |     |   |     |   |
     ---       ---                 ---       --- 
        |     |   |         |     |   |         |
     ---       ---                 ---           

Sometimes 7 and 9 have "serif" segments 

     ---        --- 
    |   |      |   |
                --- 
        |          |
                --- 

The C<seven =E<gt> $integer> and C<nine =E<gt> $integer> options give how
many segments those digits should be reckoned.  Seven can be 3 or 4.  Nine
can be 5 or 6.

The total is similar to L<Math::NumSeq::DigitSum>, but with digits mapped
through a table of segment counts 0-E<gt>6, 1-E<gt>2, 2-E<gt>5, etc.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::SevenSegments-E<gt>new ()>

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::SevenSegments-E<gt>new (seven =E<gt> $int, nine =E<gt> $int)>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=back

=head2 Random Access

=over

=item C<$value = $seq-E<gt>ith($i)>

Return the number of segments to display C<$i> in 7-segment LEDs.

=item C<$i = $seq-E<gt>i_start ()>

Return 0, the first term in the sequence being at i=0.
